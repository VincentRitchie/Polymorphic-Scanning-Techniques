## Description
This repository contains a Python project that demonstrates the use of polymorphism in implementing various scanning techniques. The application allows users to create different types of scanning tools (like Port Scanners, Ping Scanners, and Vulnerability Scanners) and execute them at once against specified targets.

## Features
- **Dynamic Scanner Creation:** Users can create different types of scanners (Port, Ping, Vulnerability) by specifying the scanner type.
- **Scanner Execution:** Execute the scanners on specified targets with additional parameters (like ports) based on the scanner type.

## Installation
To install and run this project, follow these steps:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/VincentRitchie/Polymorphic-Scanning-Techniques.git
cd Polymorphic-Scanning-Techniques
```

## Usage
To use this project, run the following command:

```sh
python polymorphic_scanner.py
```

Follow the prompts to create and execute your scanning tools.

## Future Enhancements

### 1. **Additional Scanning Techniques**
   - **Description**: Introduce more scanning types such as Network Mapping, OS Fingerprinting, etc.
   - **Benefit**: Expands the range of scanning tools available within the application simultaneously.

### 2. **Integration with Real Scanning Tools**
   - **Description**: Integrate the application with real-world scanning tools like Nmap, OpenVAS, etc.
   - **Benefit**: Enhances functionality by allowing actual network scanning operations.

### 3. **Advanced User Interface**
   - **Description**: Develop a more user-friendly interface, possibly with a GUI or an advanced CLI with more options.
   - **Benefit**: Provides a more intuitive experience for users.

### 4. **Scan Result Logging**
   - **Description**: Implement logging of scan results to a file.
   - **Benefit**: Keeps a record of all scanning activities, useful for reporting and analysis.

### 5. **Task Automation**
   - **Description**: Allow users to automate and schedule scanning tasks.
   - **Benefit**: Increases efficiency by allowing recurring or scheduled scans.
